<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project brief was to practice using an API to create an interactive React app. This Jammming app fetches data from Spotifys API in order to allow users to search for and add tracks to a custom playlist which they then can add to their Spotify account.

This has been a really valuable & rewarding project. This is my first attempt at building a React app from scratch with structuring components and how they feed into each other. 

The next step is Part Two - create and implement a new feature through technical design.

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

These are instructions on setting up the project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

<!-- 1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com) -->
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mattsteen14/jammming.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your Client ID in `Spotify.js`
   For a guide on how to obtain a Spotify client ID: [Spotify Application Registration Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps).
   ```js
   const clientID = 'ENTER YOUR CLIENT ID';
   ```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
